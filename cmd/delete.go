		The required struct to generate a yaml file should already be present in the operator.
		This also creates a tight depedency to the operator itself including
		api versions and the corresponding data schema comprising configurable attributes.
		This means that the CLI version needs to be kept in sync with the operator versions.
		Assuming that more and more services will be supported, it may require to
		modify the CLI from various teams.

		Hence, over time the codebase must be split into sub modules and some types of changes must happen
		fully automtically or otherwise the release process becomes a nightmare and may lead to
		a large delay between operator and CLI releases.
