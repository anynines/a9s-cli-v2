### Fixed

- all services: a9s SPI: Fix an issue that was introduced in the context of "Revision of certificate handling and
  standardization between the different a9s Data Services".
  As soon as the SPI and the templates of an a9s Data Service are updated, no new backups or restores can be triggered,
  and the bindings of the corresponding TLS/SSL service instances cannot be changed until the service instance is
  updated too. This is caused by an internal migration of the data structure which is only performed during an update of
  a service instance. Non-TLS/SSL service instances and newly created service instances are not affected.
