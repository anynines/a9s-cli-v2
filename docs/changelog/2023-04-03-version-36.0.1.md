## 

### Fixed

- a9s Backup Manager: Add missing configuration `anynines-backup-manager.jobs.backup_fragment.max_attempts`. This
  configuration is **only** relevant if you have at least one a9s PostgreSQL service instance in your environment with
  Continuous Archiving enabled. In this case, without the mentioned configuration, backups for these service instances
  cannot be handled and it leads to failing background workers of the a9s Backup Manager and so to a decreasing
  functionality of the a9s Backup Service.
