### Fixed

- a9s Messaging: SPI: Fix typo in the alternative name of the SPI certificate. The problem causes issues with the
  communication between the a9s Service Broker and a9s Messaging SPI.
- all services: consul-dns: Fix failure when bootstrapping. The post-start script would fail when attempting to remove
  the stale entries.
